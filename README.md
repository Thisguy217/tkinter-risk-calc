# tkinter-risk-calc

This is a build using tkinter to help with single rolls and stuff, but I also added the ability to change colors/themes. However, the big deal that I am looking into
is that I want to find a way to toplevel the theme window, but also am open to other adds and builds for features and what not.

WARNING: The Tkinter module only works on Windows or Linux. Mac keeps having it crash or not properly formatting things, I might build some more specific stuff later, but
if someone can help give access to MacOS we can collaborate and improve it for that.
